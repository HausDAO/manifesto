# HausDAO DAO Agreement

## DAOhaus Manifesto

DAOhaus is a platform built by the people, for the people. At its core, DAOhaus looks to empower anyone adding value to the DAOhaus ecosystem, regardless of their social status or previous accolades.

The core ethos of DAOhaus is to create a truly self-sustainable protocol with integrity at heart. Community should always be prioritized over capital.

The drive to create a truly open ecosystem is one which will take form with time. At inception, DAOhaus will establish the DAOhaus DAO - the governing entity responsible for allocating funding and distributing HAUS tokens.

**The DAOhaus DAO is the core vehicle for all fundraising, token distributions and governance decisions.**

The DAOhaus DAO is built off the following principles:

- **Freedom of Choice** - Enter and exit as your please
- **Freedom of Work** - Collaboration is encouraged and necessary
- **Freedom of Power** - No one person or persons own the DAOhaus DAO. Those with the most “influence” are those who are adding the most value.
- **Freedom of Access** - Anyone adding value should receive DAO shares
- **Freedom of Pay** - Anyone holding DAO shares may submit a funding proposal
- **Freedom of Opinion** - Not all opinions will be unanimous. We encourage people to speak up and challenge any initiative or proposal which goes against the core ethos of DAOhaus.

### `HAUS` Mentality

`HAUS` is the underlying fuel of the DAOhaus ecosystem. `HAUS` does not hold initial governance rights but has 100% of the future product value.

To this, decisions regarding `HAUS` and it’s distributions should be made very cautiously. Participants should acknowledge that `HAUS` is not something to be rushed, and that it’s distribution, allocations and uses should evolve over time to ensure that new participants always have a fair way to capture upside from future protocol growth.

Owning `HAUS` does not mean that you are entitled to DAO shares. DAO shares can only be earned through continued value-added actions and represent the right to govern HAUS and it’s future.

### Building the Ownership Economy

DAOhaus looks to curate a community in which product is prioritized over profit. Any and all revenue collected by DAOhaus (either form holding `HAUS` or from contributions) should look to be allocated to value-added initiatives in the form of proposals.

While pioneered by a small team, the key contributors to DAOhaus are always meant to evolve. If successful, the DAOhaus DAO members of 5 years will look exponentially different from the DAOhaus DAO members of today.

We have laid a foundation for future communities to thrive. This manifesto will be updated in accordance to the sentiment of that community.
