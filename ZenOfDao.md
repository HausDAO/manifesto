# Zen of DAO

Decentralized is better than centralized\
Flat is better than hiarchical\
Emergence is better than planned\
Onchain is better than offchain\
Although practicality beats purity

Moloch not multisig\
or Moloch and multisig\
Permissioned is better than unpermissioned\
Exiting should be easy\
A token is not needed but a token is fine\
Token daos are still better than nothing

Reputation is key\
Collectives have power\
Users should have voice\
Community is First\
Go fast alone, go far together

Documentation counts\
Explicit is better than implicit\
Memes count\
Reward initiative\
Ask for forgivness not premission\
Now is better than never\
Recognize each other\
Diversity is a priority\
Collaboration is a priority\
Direct contribution is better than economic contribution but economic contribution is still great

Education is better than abstraction

Work streams! letâ€™s do more of those\
Cores should scale and fraction\
Small working groups work!\
bottom up with larger collectives and even larger federations\
Multiple treasuries are cool\
Ingroups are inevitable but there must be a path for edges to enter cores\
Manage equilibrium of ingroup momentum and edge community engagement

Ovoid opirtunities to be currpted
